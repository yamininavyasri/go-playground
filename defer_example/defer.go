/*
The defer statement delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
Itâ€™s often used for cleanup tasks (closing files, releasing resources, unlocking mutexes, etc.).
The deferred function runs after the current function completes.
Deferred functions execute in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order if multiple defer statements are used.
Commonly used for cleanup, like closing files, releasing locks, or printing log
basic syntax: defer functionName(arguments)
